Test1:
3-story building
Building on page 16 of Negin's report.

Test2:
9-story building
Building on page 23 of Negin's report.

Test3:
Building on page 28 of Negin's report.

Test4:
Building for following reference (prototype building):
Seismic response and performance of a steel MRF building with nonlinear viscous dampers under DBE and MCE.

Test5:
Building for the same reference with Test4, but for reduced-scale building.

Building_0, Building_1...
Those are generated from sampling space.
